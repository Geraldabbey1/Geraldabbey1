# Gerald Abbey
**Data Analyst | Python & Power BI Specialist**

I build systems that aid business processes

### Selected Work

**1. [Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)](https://github.com/Geraldabbey1/customer-segmentation-analysis)**
*Python, Pandas, Seaborn*
Instead of treating all customers the same, I used Python to segment 4,000+ users based on their purchasing behavior. This project identifies "Champions" (high-value) vs. "Hibernating" (at-risk) customers to guide marketing spend.

**2. [Executive Profit Dashboard](https://github.com/Geraldabbey1/retail-dashboard-powerbi)**
*Microsoft Power BI, DAX*
A dynamic dashboard designed for C-Suite executives. Unlike standard sales reports, this tool focuses on **Profit Margin**, highlighting a critical 15% loss in specific regions (e.g., Texas) that was previously hidden by high revenue numbers.

**3. [Electronics Sales Optimization](https://github.com/Geraldabbey1/electronics-sales-analytics)**
*Python, ETL, Data Cleaning*
Engineered an automated pipeline to merge 12 months of fragmented sales data. The analysis pinpointed the optimal times for ad campaigns (11 AM & 7 PM) and identified high-probability product bundles.


### Technical Stack
* **Core:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
* **Visualization:** Power BI (Advanced DAX), Matplotlib
* **Workflow:** Git, Jupyter Notebooks, ETL Pipelines
